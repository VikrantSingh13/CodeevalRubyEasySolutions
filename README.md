Ruby solutions for Codeeval challenges

  I wrote these solutions in Ruby as part of my learning process. 
Most of these solutions are about 33-34/35, 63/65, and 97/100 points for 
easy, medium, and hard challenges on Codeeval. However, some of them can 
still be improved, to achieve near perfect points on Codeeval.

  Only partial descriptions of the challenges are included with the solutions.

P.s. If you're getting "not unique" for the solutions, changing the name of the 
variables and/or adding your own comments/docstring might help. :P
