Ruby solutions for Codeeval easy challenges

URL: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/

I wrote these solutions in Ruby as part of my learning process. 
Most of these solutions are about 33-34/35 points on Codeeval.
However, some of them can still be improved, to achieve near perfect points on Codeeval.

P.s. If you're getting "not unique" for the solutions, changing the name of the 
variables and/or adding your own comments/docstring might help. :P
